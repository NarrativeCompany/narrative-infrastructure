# Jenkins Job DSL API

Welcome to the Narrative Jenkins Job DSL folder. This folder will contain all Jenkins jobs found at <https://jenkins.narrative.cloud>. New jobs can be submitted via pull requests to the infrastructure repository on Github.

All jobs named `*.groovy` will be created/updated when any code is pushed to the master branch of the infrastructure repository. Use the `dsl_demo.groovy` as an example. Also see the <https://jenkins.narrative.cloud/plugin/job-dsl/api-viewer/index.html> API viewer, it's very useful.
